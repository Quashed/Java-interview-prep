### OOP

## Four pillars of OOP

### Encapsulation
- Wrapping data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
- Use `private` fields + `public` getters/setters to protect data.

## Abstraction
- Hiding implementation details and only showing essential details.
- Use abstract classes or interaces.

## Inheritance
- Create new classes from existing ones.
- `extends` keyword, supports code reuse and method overriding.

## Polymorphism
- Many forms of the same method.
- Two types:
  - **Compile-time (Method Overloading)** — same method name, different parameters.
  - **Runtime (Method Overriding)** — subclass provides its own version of a method.
